# Exceed #17 - Website

This website is a website for Exceed Camp #17. It uses for convenience and clarity for the money system that is an essential part of the camp this time.

## Why do we need to do this?

The money system is the new thing in the Exceed Camp, and it's not an easy thing to understand. Because of that, It may already make someone feel a little dizzy. So we want to make it less complicated by making a decent GUI. The website is good-looking and easy to use, and it also can access from anywhere or any device. So the website is our best shot this time.

## Framework/Language

We use Flask for the backend part and ordinary HTML CSS and JavaScript for the frontend.
