# Exceed #17 - Website
---
This website is a website for Exceed Camp #17. It uses for convenience and clarity for the money system that is an essential part of the camp this time.

## Why do we need to do this?
---
The money system is the new thing in the Exceed Camp, and it's not an easy thing to understand. Because of that, It may already make someone feel a little dizzy. So we want to make it less complicated by making a decent GUI. The website is good-looking and easy to use, and it also can access from anywhere or any device. So the website is our best shot this time.

## Framework/Language
---
We use Flask for the backend part and ordinary HTML CSS and JavaScript for the frontend.
